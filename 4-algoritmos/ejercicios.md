## Cuadrados de un arreglo

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Example 1

```js
Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].
```

### Example 2

```js
Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
```

## Palíndromo

A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

### Example 1

``` js
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
```

### Example 2

```js
Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
```

### Example 3

```js
Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.
```

## String al revés

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

### Example 1

```js
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

### Example 2

```js
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```
